My goal is to master these fundamentals by Friday.' },

I made solid progress in various areas, including setting up my learning portfolio website, familiarizing myself with the basics of C++, configuring the IDE with the C++ for Games framework, and initiating work on the Game Design Document (GDD). However, I recognize that I could have devoted more time to refining the GDD had I not spent an extended period developing my website. This experience serves as a valuable lesson in balancing project priorities and time management, which I aim to optimize in the upcoming weeks.',

Starting next week, I will be more careful with my planning and time management to avoid any delays in my work. These lessons will help me work smarter in the upcoming weeks of the course.'
